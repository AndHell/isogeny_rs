# Isogeny

A Rust library for isogeny-based cryptography

## :construction: Everything will Change Always :construction:

At the moment, this repo is a bit of a dump of various previous projects. If you're interested in collaborating, get in touch, but there's a lot to figure out before collaboration becomes easier!

## Associated Work

This repository has started as a collection and refactoring of some isogeny-based cryptography research papers.
